MAX: 9:30
- running trajectory analysis on simulated data
- interested in trajectory analysis with clustering draft data

ROJIN: 10
- immune data
- reduce the size of data:
    = unsupervised clustering methods
        - auto encorder looks promising
- draft could be scanPy, easy to run
    - Andrew has been looking at it
    - Henry knows something about it

VERENA: 10:30
- expression profiles
- from clustering find a good representation of cell types
    - expression profile for each cluster

MOLLY: 11
- auto-encoder to get 1000, 100, 2 dimensions
- maybe first draft of all data

ANDREW: 12
- import seurat & scanPy objects
- marker genes per organ/tissue

YIANNI: 4
machine learning


JOSH QUESTIONS:
- Rojin:
    - how to get to aws
    - should scanPy

WEDNESDAY MEETING AGENDA:
- preliminary data using a simple tool
- a common output format
- connect cluster analysis people together
- tools for clustering

INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS:
    - meet Josh' commitments for the chan-zucherberg grant
    - analysis in tandem
    - something tangible you can point to show others what you've done
    - veracity score:
       - just testing the database
       - prior to preliminary draft
       - preliminary draft
       - first draft
       - second draft
       - third draft
       - my rotation time is up, this is the best I have
       - I am now a PhD, this is the best I have
       - I am satisfied with this data and probably won't have revisions

- erich: other machines

UI BEFORE ANYONE UPLOADS:
- logins
- proxy
- on production
- 'draft storyboard' on all pages
- ui: upload reference files
- thermometer

UPLOADS:
- generalize NavBar analysis menu list for use by other lists
- make upload/page work for analysisInput and reference
- format aliases:
    - expressionMatrix, geneMatrix, featureMatrix
    - geneList, markerGenes, geneBag, pathway

CROWD SOURCING:
- give recognition on web page
- allow access to our data if you donate
